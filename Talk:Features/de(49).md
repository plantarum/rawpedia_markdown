# What means pan-around-photo and pan-rate-amplification

This point is not possible to translate for me:

- Easily pan around photos much larger than your screen thanks to pan
  rate amplification, eliminating the need for numerous and fidgety
  mouse movements,

I estimate, that a pan around photo means a photo with an extreme aspect
ratio. Mostly stitched from the camera during the shot. I'm right? But
what the hell is a pan rate amplification? :-O Please, explain this to
me for a good translation.
