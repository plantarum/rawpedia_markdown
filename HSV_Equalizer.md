The *HSV Equalizer* (Hue, Saturation and Value) works in the [HSV color
space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV). Use it to selectively
change colors, e.g. make the sky more dramatic by making it somewhat
darker or more saturated without touching other colors. It can be very
useful for correcting skin tones as well. 'Incorrect' use may produce
effects resembling the analogue cross-processing technique. When used
for black-and-white, be sure that the raw is desaturated by setting the
[Chromaticity](Lab_Adjustments#Chromaticity "wikilink") slider in the
[Lab Adjustments](Lab_Adjustments "wikilink") tool to -100, or by
enabling the [Black-and-White](Black-and-White "wikilink") tool. The
*HSV Equalizer* does not work when the raw file is desaturated by
setting [Saturation](Exposure#Saturation "wikilink") in the
[Exposure](Exposure "wikilink") tool to -100.

There is a description of how the [flat curve
type](General_Comments_About_Some_Toolbox_Widgets#The_Flat_Curve "wikilink")
works in the [General Comments About Some Toolbox
Widgets](General_Comments_About_Some_Toolbox_Widgets "wikilink")
chapter.
