The **Faded Pack profiles** allow the application of nostalgic,
thematic, sentimental looks to images with a general appearance of faded
colors and additional color toning that is varied across the luminosity
range of the image. Most profiles come in three variants:

1.  The base version,
2.  a TM ([tone-mapped](Tone_Mapping "wikilink")) version, and
3.  a slightly brighter tone-mapped version.

A side benefit of these profiles is that they handle burnt highlights
very gracefully, making their appearance more natural and seamless with
the rest of the image.

The essence of the toning effect is created mostly by settings of the
[Channel Mixer](Channel_Mixer "wikilink") and [RGB
Curves](RGB_Curves "wikilink") (both in Color Tab). Channel mixer adds
the fading effect and RGB curves apply the further color toning.

To tune profile to personal taste, one could adjust the RGB curves to
alter the coloring effect. If color toning is acceptable, one could
continue image adjustments with the tone curves in the
[exposure](exposure "wikilink") panel.
