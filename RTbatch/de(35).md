RTbatch is a
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
script which allows you to easily process an input image with all of
RawTherapee's built-in processing profiles and export either full-size
pictures or lower resolution previews. RTbatch can also export
[markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) code for displaying
galleries of your images on websites that parse markdown (currently this
is only implemented for [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) using the
*imgcap* or *img* tags).

The script also comes with a command-line utility, *RTbatch_cli*, with
which you can call it and pass all arguments in a single line from your
terminal.
