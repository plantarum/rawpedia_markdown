## General Features

- All the standard features you would expect from a raw developer and
  much more,
- A batch processing queue to make tweaking a photo as fast as possible
  while leaving the CPU grunt work queued up for later,
- [Floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point)
  engine - the only raw developer on the market which does all
  calculations in precise floating point notation so nothing gets
  rounded off and lost,
- [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions)
  optimizations for better performance on modern CPUs,
- [Color management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management)
  using the [LittleCMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleCMS) v2
  color management system for more precise color handling, providing
  control over working and output color space,
- Support for reading and tone-mapping 16-bit, 24-bit and 32-bit
  floating-point HDR images in the DNG format,
- File browser featuring colored tagging, searching (by text matched to
  the filename), metadata filtering (by file type, camera model, lens
  model, photo parameters),
- Support for DCP and [ICC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile)
  color profiles, for precise colors or for replicating the “camera
  look” to match out-of-camera JPEG images,
- A history panel to easily see what changes you made and jump back to a
  specific point,
- A snapshot panel to work with multiple versions of changes to a photo,
- A flexible UI where panels and some individual elements can be adapted
  or hidden,
- Easily pan around photos much larger than your screen thanks to pan
  rate amplification, eliminating the need for numerous and fidgety
  mouse movements,
- Scroll the tool panels using your mouse scroll wheel without worrying
  about accidentally misadjusting any tools, or hold the Shift key while
  using the mouse scroll wheel to manipulate the adjuster the cursor is
  hovering over,
- Maximize screen-space by right-clicking on a tool to keep it visible
  while automatically collapsing the other ones,
- A Before\|After view to compare your latest change to any previous
  one,
- Support for PP3 processing profiles ([sidecar
  files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidecar_file)), whole and
  partial,
- Show various channels in the preview: red, green, blue, luminosity and
  a focus mask,
- Show various channels in the histogram: red, green, blue,
  [CIELAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space) luminance,
  chromaticity and raw,
- [Color clipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(photography))
  indicators in the preview,
- Export Panel with Fast Export Options,
- Keyboard shortcuts to speed up work,
- Command line support to automate RawTherapee using scripts or call it
  from other programs,
- Support for most cameras,
- Support new raw formats by simply editing the
  [camconst.json](camconst.json "wikilink") file in a text editor,
- Audio feedback to inform you when a CPU-intensive task completes e.g.
  when the queue is done being processed,
- Preserve [IPTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPTC) and
  [XMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Metadata_Platform) of
  pre-tagged files,
- Adapt RawTherapee to use your system interface's color scheme and
  widgets or try the provided custom color schemes,
- Localization in almost 30 languages.

## Exposure and Color Features

- The Auto Levels tool tweaks your photos to provide a good starting
  point,
- Various powerful methods of shadow and highlight recovery and
  reconstruction,
- Post-crop Vignette Filter,
- Graduated Filter (GND),
- Pipette tool, which, when activated for a specific curve, lets you
  pick a point on the image preview and then places a corresponding
  adjustment point on that curve,
- Two RGB tone curves, each with four methods of control, for
  unprecedented control of colors and exposure,
- Hue, saturation and value (HSV) and red, green and blue (RGB) curve
  adjustments,
- Wealth of Lab adjustments for separate control of colors and
  luminance:
  - L\* curve for control of lightness,
  - a\* curve to control the position of a color between red/magenta and
    green,
  - b\* curve to control the position of a color between yellow and
    blue,
  - LH curve to control luminance as a function of hue,
  - CH curve to control chromaticity as a function of hue,
  - HH curve to control hue as a function of hue,
  - CC curve to control chromaticity as a function of chromaticity,
  - LC curve to control luminance as a function of chromaticity,
  - CL curve to control chromaticity as a function of luminance.
- Avoid color shift by using [Munsell
  correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsell_color_system),
- Vibrance control,
- Preservation of natural skin tones,
- [Tone mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_mapping) based on
  [edge-preserving decomposition](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~danix/epd/)
  for a natural look,
- [White balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_balance) -
  automatic, manual or one of a wide variety of predefined sources,
- Channel Mixer,
- Black-and-White conversion,
- Several methods of color toning,
- Support for [monochrome](Demosaicing#Monochrome_Cameras "wikilink")
  cameras
- Adaptation of the [CIECAM02](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02)
  color appearance model ratified by the International Commission on
  Illumination (CIE) to maintain accurate colors and to, given a set of
  initial viewing condition parameters, convert the image so that it
  will look the same under the target viewing conditions. Image
  processing using CIECAM02 is enabled via a number of methods, using
  curves and sliders. A multitude of tools are adapted to auto-switch to
  CIECAM02 mode when in use, including [Tone
  Mapping](Tone_Mapping "wikilink"),
  [Sharpening](Sharpening "wikilink"), [Defringe](Defringe "wikilink"),
  etc.
- Color management.

## Detail Features

- Various sharpening methods:
  - [Unsharp mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsharp_mask) featuring
    a unique and powerful threshold slider to bring out detail while
    avoiding halos,
  - [RL
    deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson%E2%80%93Lucy_deconvolution)
    to undo the blur,
  - [Edges](https://web.archive.org/web/20110625093654/http://www.rawness.es/sharpening/?lang=en)
    true sharpening to enhance edges,
  - Microcontrast to enhance texture,
  - Contrast by Detail Levels using wavelet decomposition into five
    levels of detail.
