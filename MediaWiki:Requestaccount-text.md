RawPedia is free for everyone to read. You do not need an account to
read RawPedia.

Accounts are only for people who want to be able to make edits. In order
to maintain a high quality of information and to prevent spam, we only
allow people who are trusted and experienced in photography, digital
photo processing or translation to create accounts. We must know you
from the forum, GitHub or elsewhere. **You absolutely must** contact us
preferably before, or immediately after requesting an account.

Contact us via the [official
forum](https://discuss.pixls.us/c/software/rawtherapee) and let us know:

- Why you want an account,
- What your RawPedia username is.

Once the account is approved, you will be emailed a notification message
and the account will be usable at [login](Special:UserLogin "wikilink").
