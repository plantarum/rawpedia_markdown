# Die Registerkarte Dateiverwaltung

![](Rt_setm_fb.png "Rt_setm_fb.png") The File Browser tab is where you
review your photos, select photos for editing, or perform batch-editing
operations. It consists of the following parts:

- The left panel
  - The "Places" panel on the top links to your home folder, USB card
    readers, the system's default "photos" folder, or custom folders.
  - Below this is a standard tree-type file browser that you can use to
    navigate to folders containing your photos. RawTherapee does not
    complicate things by requiring you to import photos into databases
    as some other software do.
- The right panel
  - The "Develop" tab allows you to apply tool settings to the selected
    image or images. This allows you to quickly enable some tool in many
    photos at once.
  - The "Inspect" tab shows a preview at a fixed scale of 100% of the
    image your mouse cursor is hovering over, which is either the
    largest JPEG image embedded in the raw file, or the image itself
    when hovering over non-raw images.
  - The "Filter" tab lets you show only photos which match the
    parameters you specify.
  - The "Fast Export" tab lets you quickly process the selected images
    by bypassing certain tools even if they are enabled in the
    processing profiles of those images, so that you can get a quick
    preview of the raw files for example to delete the shots which are
    blurry or out of focus.
- The central panel shows thumbnails of the folder currently selected.

You can hide the individual panels using the "Show/Hide the left panel
![<File:Panel-to-left.png>](Panel-to-left.png "File:Panel-to-left.png")"
and "Show/Hide the right panel
![<File:Panel-to-right.png>](Panel-to-right.png "File:Panel-to-right.png")"
buttons - see the [Keyboard Shortcuts](Keyboard_Shortcuts "wikilink")
page.

When you open a folder, RawTherapee will generate thumbnails of the
photos in that folder in the central panel. The first time you open a
folder full of raw photo files (we'll refer to folders full of photos as
"albums"), RawTherapee will read each file and create a thumbnail based
on the embedded JPEG image (every raw photo has an embedded JPEG image,
sometimes even a few of various sizes). This can take some time on
larger albums, but it only happens the first time you open an album. All
subsequent times you go to a previously opened folder, RawTherapee will
read the thumbnails from its cache if they exist, and this will be much
faster than the first time you opened that folder.

The JPEG image embedded in each raw photo is identical to the
out-of-camera JPEG image you would get if you shot in JPEG mode (or in
"RAW+JPEG" mode). This JPEG is not representative of the actual raw data
in that photo, because your camera applies all kinds of tweaks to the
JPEG image, such as increasing the exposure a bit, increasing
saturation, contrast, sharpening, etc.

After you start editing a photo, its thumbnail in the *File Browser* tab
is replaced with what you see in the preview in the *Editor* tab, and
every tweak you make is reflected in the thumbnail. The thumbnails are
stored in the cache for quick future access. If you want to revert to
the embedded JPEG image as the thumbnail, then right-click on the
thumbnail (or selection of thumbnails) and select "*Processing Profile
Operations \> Clear*".

Use the zoom icons in the File Browser's top toolbar to make the
thumbnails smaller or larger. Each thumbnail uses some memory (RAM), so
it is advisable not to set the thumbnail size too high ("*Preferences \>
File Browser \> Maximal Thumbnail Height*").

You can filter the visible photos by using the buttons in the *File
Browser's* or
*[Filmstrip](The_Image_Editor_Tab#The_Filmstrip "wikilink")'s* top
toolbar, as well as by using the "*Find*" box or the "*Filter*" tab.
Possible uses:

- Show only unedited photos,
- Show only photos bracketed +2EV,
- Show only photos ranked as 5 star,
- Show only photos with a specific ISO range,
- Show only photos with a NEF extension.
