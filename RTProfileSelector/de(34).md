**RTProfileSelector** is a RawTherapee plugin that automatically selects
custom processing profiles (.pp3 files) based on user-defined rules. The
rules are sets of Exif fields and values which are matched against the
actual values extracted from the raw files the first time they are
opened in RawTherapee.

A few things you can automate in RawTherapee through RTProfileSelector:

- Assign your own custom processing profiles to approximatelly match
  your camera settings (such as "monochrome"/"black-and-white", "vivid
  colour", "film modes", etc.)
- Set noise reduction parameters in RawTherapee according to camera
  model and ISO value
- Assign lens correction profiles (LCP) based on the lens and camera
  model used

RTProfileSelector is written in C++11 and compiles on both Windows and
Linux. Source code and Windows executable can be downloaded from its
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcapelini/RTProfileSelector).
RTProfileSelector uses
[ExifTool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) for extracting
metadata from images.
