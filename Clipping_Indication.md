The clipped shadow
![<File:Warning-shadows.png>](Warning-shadows.png "File:Warning-shadows.png")
and
![<File:Warning-highlights.png>](Warning-highlights.png "File:Warning-highlights.png")
highlight indicators in the Editor allow you to easily see which areas
of the image are too dark or too bright. Highlighted areas are shaded
according to the much they transgress the thresholds.

The thresholds for these indicators are defined in Preferences \>
General.

The clipped shadow indicator will highlight areas where all three
channels fall at or below the specified shadow threshold. The clipped
highlight indicator will highlight areas where at least one channel lies
at or above the specified highlight threshold.

Clipping is calculated using data which depends on the state of the
gamut button
![<File:Gamut-hist.png>](Gamut-hist.png "File:Gamut-hist.png") which you
can toggle above the main preview in the Editor tab. When the gamut
button is enabled the working profile is used, otherwise the
gamma-corrected output profile is used.
