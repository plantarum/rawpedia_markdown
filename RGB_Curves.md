RGB curves allow to apply a curve adjustment individually to each of the
RGB channels. This provides a fine control over image color balance when
curves applied to each of the RGB channels are different. Using RGB
curves one could make warmer highlights or colder shadows, simulate film
cross-processing effect, etc.

## Luminosity Mode

The purpose of *Luminosity Mode* in the *RGB Curves* tool is to alter
image luminosity by changing the contribution of the RGB channels to it,
while keeping image color the same.

The effect is somewhat similar to *V* changes in the [HSV
Equalizer](HSV_Equalizer "wikilink"), but is smoother and broader across
hues, not as selective. When working on black-and-white images, similar
adjustments could be made via the [Channel
Mixer](Channel_Mixer "wikilink"), but *RGB Curves* allow a finer
control.
