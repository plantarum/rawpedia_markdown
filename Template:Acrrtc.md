The curve used in some of RawTherapee's bundled DCP profiles is the same
as the default curve used by Adobe Camera Raw. You can get the curve
from this `.rtc` file. In the Exposure tool set either Tone Curve 1 or
Tone Curve 1 to "Custom", set the curve mode to "Film-Like", and apply
this file: (the file will be available soon)
