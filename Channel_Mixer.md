The *Channel Mixer* is used for special effects, for color and
black-and-white alike. The *Channel Mixer* is divided into three
sections: Red, Green and Blue. Those sections represent the three
available color output channels in a RGB image. All values shown here
are percentages. The mixer makes a new R channel from the specified
percentages of the existing R, G, and B channels; similarly for the
other channels.

The *Channel Mixer* can be used to adjust the white balance of the
photo, if the proper *White Balance* tool does not suffice. For the
sliders that have a starting value of 100, enter values other than 100
and you are in effect changing the white balance (i.e. only changing the
R slider on the R channel, only the G slider on the G channel, and only
the B slider on the B channel). Get the image into the right ballpark,
then use the *Temperature*/*Tint* sliders of the usual *White Balance*
tool to fine tune. In principle this allows an arbitrary range for
*White Balance*.
