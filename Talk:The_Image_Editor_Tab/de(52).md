Question "Navigator": What does this mean:

RawTherapee 5.1 (and current development versions of the "pixelshift"
branch) can show the real raw photosite values. To see them, set the
Navigator to use the \[0-255\] range, apply the Neutral processing
profile, then set the Demosaicing method to "None". The Navigator will
show the real raw photosite values after black level subtraction within
the range of the original raw data.

Highest Version is 5.0. Does any user what read the manual know the
pixelshift branch. There is not a compiled development 5.1.
