I assume that the explanations are not correct. In my opinion

- support is not possible for new raw data formats, means a file format
  with new coding
- support is possible for new cameras or new sensors by using a known
  raw data format
- camconst.json can adjust the scaling of pixel values between a pixel
  is *empty* and *full-well*
- camconst.json can adjust color correction based on D65? (cross
  correction of the color channels)

Status: open. Maybe reading of camconst.json make sense for me.
