*Vibrance* is an intelligent saturation adjustment tuned to correlate
with the color sensitivity of human vision. The vibrance effect is
applied with higher accuracy on a correctly white balanced image when
the RGB *Saturation* and Lab *Chromaticity* sliders are set to 0. You
can separately control the vibrance of *pastel* tones (tones of low
saturation) and *saturated* tones (as the name implies, tones of high
saturation).

## Interface Description

### Pastel/Saturated Tones

These *Pastel Tones* and *Saturated Tones* sliders let you individually
control saturation of saturated and pastel tones.

### Pastel/Saturated Tones Threshold

The threshold adjuster lets you differentiate between pastel and
saturated tones - the threshold between what is considered a pastel tone
and what is considered to be saturated.

### Protect Skin Tones

When enabled, colors closely resembling natural skin tones are not
affected by the vibrance adjustments.

### Avoid Color Shift

When enabled, exercises extra control to avoid hue shifting.

### Link Pastel and Saturated Tones

When enabled, the vibrance level is adjusted with a single slider
equally controlling saturation of both pastel and saturated colors.

### Skin Tones - Hue According to Hue

[thumb](image:Vibrance_hh.jpg "wikilink") This H=f(H) curve lets you
change the hue of skin tones. It behaves just like the tone curve you
know from any image editing program, but instead of working on a whole
color channel it just works on a range of common skin tones. The x axis
represents the input hue, and the y axis the output hue. Decide on the
specific skin tone hue you want to change (the one your subject has in
the photo), find it on the x axis, and then change the curve to map it
to a nicer tone on the y axis. In practical terms, you can use this tool
to map a British-pink suntan skin color to a nice Maldives-brown one.
