## Usage

Needs an explanation and real-life examples of when this can be used.
The old Google Docs manual gave two uses: "Extending the range of White
Balance beyond the 1200-12000 range of the WB tool" and to adjust
black-and-white photography, both of which are obsolete now - the *White
Balance* tool has a range of 1500-60000 and there is a dedicated
*Black-and-White* tool. [DrSlony](User:DrSlony "wikilink")
